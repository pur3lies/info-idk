i really felt like doing a simple repository with all infos about me because why not ok.

__INFO__
- you can call me __jester__ or jes, or any of my __kin names__. some people call me bex too, but its an old name which im trying to get rid of it slowly, so id prefer if yall not use it
- im okay with nicknames ! pet names are exclusively for my bf. 
- i use __they/them__ and __it/its__ pronouns, as i am agender and nonbinary. you can also call me by he/him or she/her occasionally, if we are close and if you're referring to me as my kins, in that case you can use the character's pronouns.
- i am __bisexual, aegosexual and demiromantic__. i also have a boyfriend so dont flirt with me or interact with the intent of getting with me, it won't work.
- i am __18__. despite this im very childish ik but still, im an adult, i dont want kids interacting with me
- i speak english and italian, eng is not my native language so i may be lowk bad at it
- oh gosh i have the worst memory ever, i will forget ANYTHING. be patient if i ask you to remind me something 
- im an __ambivert__, im okay with social situations / interactions but im also okay on my own, i'll need my spaces. i can be shy or awkward, so the 99% of times i wont interact first.
- my __HEAVY__ / main kins are __looey__, glisten, gourdy, astro, shrimpo [DW], __alastor__, angel [HH], __jax__, pomni [TADC], __shadowmilk cookie__ [CRK], pierrot [TFC] and i have more but theyre not really relevant. idm doubles unless you say ''im this character more than you'' like ?? oh ok. in that case DNI.
- i have a lot of issues which i dont wanna make my whole personality, but just a heads up : paranoia, anger / trust / jealousy issues (which im working on fixing), bpd, hypersexuality. i am very unstable in general lol but i promise im a good person ok..
- if im in a bad mood, i will tend to isolate myself, and if i dont, i beg interact with care, anything can be a trigger, and im serious unfortunately
- i want my boundaries respected. if i say iwc, dniuf, dni etc. you have to respect it
- if we get close i will probably insult you jokingly, if youre uncomfortable with that tell me !! its just my love language trust
- if youre looking for serious comfort dont come at me twin im SO bad at comforting. but i will always listen anyway. also my advices are way too honest so if youre someone who hates honesty you will most likely not like me
- i hate competition. my mind will make anything into a fucking competition. avoid saying stuff like ''im *character* n1 fan !!'' ''i love this more than you''
